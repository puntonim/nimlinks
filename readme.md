# nimlinks

**nimlinks** is a set of tools for macOS to create and handle special links to files.
These special links overcome a few problems that affect regular symbolic links and alias:
 - they are ignored by many sync service like Synology Drive and Owncloud/Nextcloud
 - they are not flexible enough with remote location: if a regular link is created over an AFP connection in LAN it
 won't work when connected to the same remote over a WebDAV connection in WAN.
